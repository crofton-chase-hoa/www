Exterior changes to your home or lot must be approved by the Architectural Request Committee.  Submit a copy of the [Architectural Improvement Request](/assets/pdfs/Architectural Improvement Request.pdf) to [ProCom](/procom/) for review.  Reviews generally take just a few days.  Below you'll find guidance on a number of common requests:

**Exterior paint** and **siding** should be colored ....  **Trim** should be colored ....  **Doors** should be colored ...

**Fences** must be split rail or board-on-board.  Split-rail fences may have 2 or 3 rails, a maximum height of 48 inches, and may have dark green wire mesh installed on the interior side of the fence.  Board-on-board fences may have a maximum height of 6 feet with 8 foot sections.  Fences may not extend beyond the front building line of the home or the adjacent homes.  Fences should be constructed of treated, natural-color lumber.  Painting of fences is prohibited.  Chain-link is prohibited.

**Retaining walls** must be constructed of pressure-treated lumber, stone, and/or brick similar in color to that found in the home.  Retaining walls may not exceed 3 feet in height.
