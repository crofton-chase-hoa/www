Although Anne Arundel County moved to Stage 2 at 5:00 pm on Friday, June 5th, playgrounds remain closed according to [the county's revised FAQ](https://www.aacounty.org/coronavirus/road-to-recovery/Revised%20FAQ%20June%205.pdf):
> **Are playgrounds open?** No, county and community playgrounds remain closed. There is no way to ensure proper social distancing and group sizes in these areas.

Please do not use the playground at the park.
